subscriptions
=============

Subscriptions for the [RequestPolicyContinued](https://requestpolicycontinued.github.io/) Firefox addon.

Subscriptions are preset rules for RequestPolicy Continued. Subscriptions are configurable through the `Preferences -> Manage Policies -> Subscriptions` menu of the addon.
Enabling a subscription will load a preconfigured allow/deny policy for certain sites. For example, subscriptions can:
 * Block some known web tracking services.
 * Allow certain sites to work properly by allowing them to request required elements from other domains (Content Delivery Networks..).
 
Currently this repository only contains the _official_ subscriptions, copied from the original project on requestpolicy.com.

## Contributing
If you think a rule should be added to official subscriptions, of if you would like to submit your own subscription list, let us know in the [issues tracker](issues) of this repository.
If you have a question or remark about how RequestPolicy Continued handles subscriptions, check the [main project issue tracker](https://github.com/RequestPolicyCOntinued/requestpolicy/issues).
